# Adjacency List: Data Structure and Implementation

## Overview
The **Adjacency List** is a data structure used to represent graphs consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). In an adjacency list, each vertex is associated with a list of its neighboring vertices. This structure is commonly used to efficiently represent sparse graphs, where the number of edges is much smaller than the number of possible edges.

## Implementation of Adjacency List
Adjacency lists can be implemented in Java using collections such as:
- **HashMap:** Maps vertices to their adjacent vertices.
- **LinkedList** or **ArrayList:** Stores the adjacent vertices for each vertex.

## Basic Operations
- **Add Vertex:** Adds a new vertex to the graph. A vertex represents a node in the graph, and adding a vertex means introducing a new entity into the graph without any connections to other vertices.
- **Add Edge:** Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph. An edge represents the connection between two vertices, establishing a link that allows traversal between them.
- **Remove Vertex:** Removes a vertex and all its incident edges from the graph. This operation eliminates the vertex from the graph entirely.
- **Remove Edge:** Removes an edge between two vertices in the graph. This operation breaks the connection between two vertices without affecting the vertices themselves.
- **Find Neighbors:** Retrieves the list of neighbors (adjacent vertices) for a given vertex. Neighbors are vertices directly connected to a particular vertex via an edge.
- **Print Graph:** Prints the entire graph with its vertices and their corresponding adjacency lists. This operation allows visualization of the graph's structure.

## Applications of Adjacency List

- **Social Networks:** Adjacency lists can be used to represent social networks where the nodes are users and the edges represent friendships.
- **Computer Networks:** They can be used to model computer networks where the nodes are routers and the edges represent connections between them.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Adjacency lists are useful for finding the shortest path using algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm.
